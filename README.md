# Lightbeam for Firefox README
Today Privacy on Internet is a major concern. While you open a website, you are connected to multiple websites without even knowing that. You never know how you are being tracked on the Internet. This plugin was originally under development at github.com/mozilla/lightbeam


This is an add-on for Firefox that helps to visualize sites that may be tracking you around the internet. The add-on is available from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lightbeam/.

I am trying to create a support on Chrome for this as this add on is not avaialable on Chrome but can be very useful for the users to visualize the way the surf Internet and how are they tracked over the internet.
